              "Normally, all the sellers send delivery partner to you with the product, sellers give you promise they will send the delivery partner to you and take advance payment to process order.

But for other generic type of product COD would be there. Sellers with generic product not allowing COD is actually kinda red flag."

I started it because I have been previously scammed by these sellers on Instagram and on Reddit. Due to few bad actors all sellers are looked in same way of being potential scammer. About legitimacy, try to use, if it helps you that is good and if it scams you write about us on reddit, no one will use it after it;). DM me on whatsapp to know me more and my mission."
